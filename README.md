# FootLiveClub Mirror UI

This repository simulates a lightweight user interface used to test fallback stream mirrors, alternate routing behavior, and dynamic match display.

The layout is static and meant for interface prototyping â€” no actual streams or media content are embedded or referenced.

**Note:** This repo is used for internal QA experiments in link behavior, visual layout responsiveness, and accessibility handling. Content is placeholder-only and not intended for public use.
